## Call Log Viewer

This app intends to improve upon the UX of the call log in the default Android Phone app. It accomplishes this by organizing phone calls by phone number. It becomes easy to check if a phone number has ever called the user's phone in the past. The app displays all relevant call information associated with the phone number. Looking up the phone number is also convenient.

This app doesn't cause any side effects and is stateless, making supporting the activity lifecycle simple. Naturally, permission to read the Android call log is required.
